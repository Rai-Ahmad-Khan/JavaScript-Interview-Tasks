//We can use var, let and const.

//var was used in past but now it is not in comman use. It updates the value by
//by adding the same variable name, without letting you know. see below:
// var ab=10;
// var ab=20;
//console.log(ab);

// const is a comman practise these days.
// const bc=10;
// const bc=20;
// console.log(bc);

//let is used whenever you have to redeclare the variable: its 
//different from re declaring the element.
